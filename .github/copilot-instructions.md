# GitHub Copilot Instructions

All authoritative project guidance lives in [`CLAUDE.md`](../CLAUDE.md). Keep that file as the single source of truth for architecture, workflows, and development expectations.

## How to work in this repo
- Start every new task by reviewing `CLAUDE.md`, paying particular attention to the sections on project status, requirements, and testing habits.
- Follow the documented make targets and `uv` usage in `CLAUDE.md` when running quality checks, tests, or cluster automation.
- If you discover gaps or stale content, update `CLAUDE.md` directly and reference the change here only if you add new sections.

## Quick links into `CLAUDE.md`
- [Project status & objectives](../CLAUDE.md#project-status)
- [Development setup & tooling](../CLAUDE.md#development-setup)
- [Testing workflow expectations](../CLAUDE.md#testing-infrastructure)

## Maintenance note
Whenever these instructions need refinement, prefer improving `CLAUDE.md` and keeping this file as a thin pointer so every AI assistant reads the same canonical guidance.
