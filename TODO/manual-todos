## CRD Design Improvements

**Priority:** P1 (these affect API stability)

### Keycloak CRD
- [ ] `keycloak.spec.admin_access` → least privilege, no custom admin access (already removed)
- [x] `keycloak.spec.version` → version determined by image (✅ **COMPLETE 2025-10-05**)
- [ ] `keycloak.tls` → optional when using cert-manager, from ingress (already fine as-is)

### Realm CRD
- [x] `realm.enabled` → the resource being there manages enabled/disabled, don't allow this setting (✅ **COMPLETE 2025-10-05**)

Operator env vars, how do you pass them? If it is in an ENV field, then lets formalize them in a CRD field.
