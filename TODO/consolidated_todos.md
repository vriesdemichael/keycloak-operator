# Consolidated TODOs - Keycloak Operator

**Last Updated:** 2025-10-05
**Status:** Active development with clear priorities

---

## üî• P0 - Critical (Must Complete Before v1.0)

### Automatic Secret Rotation Handling
**Estimated Effort:** 1-2 days
**Source:** Operator enhancement for production secret management

**Current State:**
- ‚úÖ ExternalSecrets already supported (operator uses secret references everywhere)
- ‚ùå Secret changes don't trigger automatic reconciliation
- ‚ùå Rotated secrets require manual reconciliation or CRD change to apply

**Required Implementation:**
- [ ] Add Kopf watch on Secret resources
- [ ] When a secret changes, find all Keycloak/Realm/Client resources that reference it
- [ ] Trigger reconciliation for those resources
- [ ] Add integration test for secret rotation (create resource with secret ref, update secret, verify reconciliation)

**Implementation Notes:**
```python
@kopf.on.update('', 'v1', 'secrets')
async def on_secret_change(name, namespace, **kwargs):
    # Find all resources referencing this secret
    # Trigger reconciliation for each
```

**Impact:** Automatic secret rotation without manual intervention, critical for ExternalSecrets/Vault workflows

---

## üîß P1 - High Priority (Complete for Production Readiness)

### 0. Consistent Event Emission
**Estimated Effort:** 1 day
**Source:** manual-todos (moved from P0)

- [ ] Implement consistent Kubernetes event emission across all reconcilers
- [ ] Add event types: Normal (created, updated, ready) and Warning (failed, degraded)
- [ ] Write tests to verify event emission

**Impact:** Better observability in kubectl describe output

---

### 1. Complete Keycloak API Model Integration ‚úÖ COMPLETED
**Completion Date:** 2025-10-05
**Actual Effort:** ~5 hours (faster than estimated!)
**Source:** keycloak-api-integration-step-by-step.md

**Completed Work:**
- ‚úÖ Updated 19 admin client methods to use typed Pydantic models:
  - ‚úÖ Realm methods: `export_realm`, `get_realms` (2 methods)
  - ‚úÖ Client methods: `get_client_by_name`, `get_realm_clients`, `get_client_uuid` (3 methods)
  - ‚úÖ User methods: `get_service_account_user` (1 method)
  - ‚úÖ Role methods: `get_realm_role`, `get_client_role`, `assign_realm_roles_to_user`, `assign_client_roles_to_user`, `get_client_roles`, `create_client_role`, `update_client_role` (7 methods)
  - ‚úÖ Protocol mapper methods: `get_client_protocol_mappers`, `create_client_protocol_mapper`, `update_client_protocol_mapper` (3 methods)
  - ‚úÖ Advanced config methods: `configure_authentication_flow`, `configure_identity_provider`, `configure_user_federation` (3 methods)
- ‚úÖ All methods accept both `Model | dict[str, Any]` for backward compatibility
- ‚úÖ All methods return typed Pydantic models instead of dicts
- ‚úÖ Updated reconcilers and handlers to use property access
- ‚úÖ Added comprehensive usage examples to CLAUDE.md
- ‚úÖ All quality checks passing (ruff + ty/mypy)
- ‚úÖ All 167 unit tests passing

**Impact:** ‚úÖ **ACHIEVED** - Type-safe API interactions, catches errors before API calls, better IDE support

**Files Modified:**
- `src/keycloak_operator/utils/keycloak_admin.py` - Updated 19 methods with Pydantic types
- `src/keycloak_operator/handlers/client.py` - Fixed property access for ClientRepresentation
- `tests/integration/test_service_account_roles.py` - Fixed property access for UserRepresentation
- `CLAUDE.md` - Added "Admin Client Usage Examples" section with 6 detailed examples
