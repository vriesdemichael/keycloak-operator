# Consolidated TODOs - Keycloak Operator

**Last Updated:** 2025-10-05
**Status:** Active development with clear priorities

---

## 🔥 P0 - Critical (Must Complete Before v1.0)

### 1. RBAC Redesign - Two-Mode Architecture ⭐ FINAL DESIGN
**Estimated Effort:** 3-4 days
**Source:** Security review and production readiness requirements
**Status:** Design complete, ready for implementation

**Current State:**
- ❌ ClusterRole with 200+ verbs across 30+ resource types (excessive!)
- ❌ Can read/write ANY secret in the cluster (security risk)
- ❌ Can modify ANY deployment, service, ingress cluster-wide
- ❌ Single compromise = cluster-wide impact
- ❌ No namespace isolation
- ❌ Blocks production deployments in security-conscious environments

**Final Solution: Two RBAC Modes**

**Mode 1: Manual RBAC** (User-Provided) 🔒 Default, Most Secure
- Operator watches CRDs cluster-wide (read-only)
- Operator has ZERO access to user namespaces by default
- Users explicitly grant access via RoleBinding in their namespace
- Security level: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (Zero Trust)
- **Best for:** Production, security-conscious environments, compliance

**Mode 2: Automatic RBAC** (Operator-Provisioned) ⚡ Convenience
- Operator watches CRDs cluster-wide
- Operator automatically creates RoleBindings when CRDs appear
- Operator has permission to manage RoleBindings in any namespace
- Security level: ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (Requires trust in operator)
- **Best for:** Development, single-tenant, quick setup

**Key Features:**
- [ ] Centralized operator + Keycloak in `keycloak-system`
- [ ] Users define CRDs in their own namespaces
- [ ] Secrets stay in user namespaces (GitOps friendly)
- [ ] RoleBinding is the security boundary (no secret labels required)
- [ ] Operator labels its own managed secrets for cleanup tracking
- [ ] Mode selection via environment variable
- [ ] Auto-cleanup of operator-created RoleBindings
- [ ] Clear status messages guide users
- [ ] Security hardening via admission controllers (documented)
- [ ] Migration between modes without downtime

**Implementation:**
📖 See complete 7-phase plan: `TODO/rbac-security-implementation.md`

**Impact:** 
- ✅ Flexibility: Users choose security vs convenience
- ✅ Zero Trust: Manual mode has no access by default
- ✅ User Control: Explicit opt-in per namespace via RoleBinding
- ✅ Simple: No secret labeling required (labels only for operator-managed secrets)
- ✅ Revocable: Delete RoleBinding anytime
- ✅ Auditable: Query RoleBindings, operator-managed secrets
- ✅ Extensible: Additional protections via admission controllers
- ✅ 75% permission reduction from current state
- ✅ Meets enterprise security requirements

---

### 2. Automatic Secret Rotation Handling
**Estimated Effort:** 1-2 days
**Source:** Operator enhancement for production secret management
**Depends On:** RBAC redesign (secret labeling architecture)

**Current State:**
- ✅ ExternalSecrets already supported (operator uses secret references everywhere)
- ❌ Secret changes don't trigger automatic reconciliation
- ❌ Rotated secrets require manual reconciliation or CRD change to apply

**Required Implementation:**
- [ ] Add Kopf watch on Secret resources with label filter
- [ ] When a secret changes, find all Keycloak/Realm/Client resources that reference it
- [ ] Trigger reconciliation for those resources
- [ ] Add integration test for secret rotation (create resource with secret ref, update secret, verify reconciliation)
- [ ] Document secret labeling requirements for users

**Implementation Notes:**
```python
@kopf.on.update('', 'v1', 'secrets',
                labels={'keycloak.mdvr.nl/watch': 'true'})
async def on_secret_change(name, namespace, **kwargs):
    # Only labeled secrets are processed (security guarantee)
    # Find all resources referencing this secret (same namespace only)
    # Trigger reconciliation for each
```

**Security Guarantee:** Only secrets with label `keycloak.mdvr.nl/watch: "true"` are monitored

**Impact:** Automatic secret rotation without manual intervention, critical for ExternalSecrets/Vault workflows

See detailed plan in `TODO/secret-rotation-implementation.md`

## 🔧 P1 - High Priority (Complete for Production Readiness)

### 0. Consistent Event Emission
**Estimated Effort:** 1 day
**Source:** manual-todos (moved from P0)

- [ ] Implement consistent Kubernetes event emission across all reconcilers
- [ ] Add event types: Normal (created, updated, ready) and Warning (failed, degraded)
- [ ] Write tests to verify event emission

**Impact:** Better observability in kubectl describe output

**Source:** keycloak-api-integration-step-by-step.md

**Completed Work:**
- ✅ Updated 19 admin client methods to use typed Pydantic models:
  - ✅ Realm methods: `export_realm`, `get_realms` (2 methods)
  - ✅ Client methods: `get_client_by_name`, `get_realm_clients`, `get_client_uuid` (3 methods)
  - ✅ User methods: `get_service_account_user` (1 method)
  - ✅ Role methods: `get_realm_role`, `get_client_role`, `assign_realm_roles_to_user`, `assign_client_roles_to_user`, `get_client_roles`, `create_client_role`, `update_client_role` (7 methods)
  - ✅ Protocol mapper methods: `get_client_protocol_mappers`, `create_client_protocol_mapper`, `update_client_protocol_mapper` (3 methods)
  - ✅ Advanced config methods: `configure_authentication_flow`, `configure_identity_provider`, `configure_user_federation` (3 methods)
- ✅ All methods accept both `Model | dict[str, Any]` for backward compatibility
- ✅ All methods return typed Pydantic models instead of dicts
- ✅ Updated reconcilers and handlers to use property access
- ✅ Added comprehensive usage examples to CLAUDE.md
- ✅ All quality checks passing (ruff + ty/mypy)
- ✅ All 167 unit tests passing

**Impact:** ✅ **ACHIEVED** - Type-safe API interactions, catches errors before API calls, better IDE support

**Files Modified:**
- `src/keycloak_operator/utils/keycloak_admin.py` - Updated 19 methods with Pydantic types
- `src/keycloak_operator/handlers/client.py` - Fixed property access for ClientRepresentation
- `tests/integration/test_service_account_roles.py` - Fixed property access for UserRepresentation

### Current Focus Areas
1. **RBAC Redesign** (P0) ⭐ NEW - 2-3 days for least privilege architecture
2. **Secret Rotation Handling** (P0) - 1-2 days for automatic secret watches (depends on RBAC)
3. **Documentation Improvements** (P1) - 1 week effort (MkDocs site, status section, etc.)
4. **Consistent Event Emission** (P1) - 1 day for better observability

### Estimated Time to v1.0
- **Critical items (P0):** 3-5 days (RBAC redesign + secret rotation)
- **High priority items (P1):** ~1.5 weeks (API model integration done!)
- **Total to production readiness:** ~3 weeks

**Note:** RBAC redesign is now blocking P0 item because:
- Current broad permissions are production deployment blocker
- Secret rotation depends on label-based secret access architecture
- Enterprise/security-conscious environments require least privilege
- 75% permission reduction is critical security improvement
