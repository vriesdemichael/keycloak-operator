# CI/CD Improvements Tracking

This document tracks the implementation status of improvements identified in the GitHub Actions security review.

## 🔴 Phase 1: Security (Critical) - COMPLETED

- [x] **Add Trivy scanning to build-and-publish workflow**
  - Status: ✅ Implemented in `security-scan.yml` and `build-and-publish.yml`
  - Added comprehensive container image scanning
  - Integrated SARIF upload to GitHub Security tab

- [x] **Enable CodeQL for Python**
  - Status: ✅ Implemented in `security-scan.yml`
  - Running security-extended and security-and-quality queries
  - Scheduled daily runs

- [x] **Add Dependabot configuration**
  - Status: ✅ Implemented in `.github/dependabot.yml`
  - Monitors: Python deps, GitHub Actions, Docker base images, Helm charts
  - Weekly updates with automatic grouping

- [x] **Add CODEOWNERS file**
  - Status: ✅ Implemented in `.github/CODEOWNERS`
  - Critical paths require review

## 🟡 Phase 2: Reliability (High Priority) - IN PROGRESS

- [x] **Fix cluster reuse in CI**
  - Status: ✅ Fixed - now using unique cluster per run: `keycloak-operator-test-${{ github.run_id }}`
  - Ensures test isolation

- [x] **Add proper test artifact collection**
  - Status: ✅ Implemented comprehensive log collection
  - Saves: operator logs, cluster info, events, Keycloak logs, PostgreSQL logs
  - Artifacts preserved for 7 days

- [x] **Add K8s version matrix**
  - Status: ✅ Now testing against v1.28.0, v1.29.0, v1.30.0
  - Provides better compatibility validation

- [ ] **Fix workflow_run race condition**
  - Status: ⚠️ PARTIALLY FIXED - now requires both tests AND security scans
  - TODO: Consider consolidating into single workflow with job dependencies
  - Current approach is safer but more complex

- [x] **Fix Helm version pinning**
  - Status: ✅ Changed from 'latest' to 'v3.16.2'

## 🔵 Phase 3: Operability (Medium Priority) - TODO

- [ ] **Add rollback workflow**
  - Status: 📋 Planned
  - Create workflow to:
    - Mark GitHub release as draft
    - Delete/retag Docker images
    - Revert release-please version bumps

- [ ] **Create deployment workflow for staging**
  - Status: 📋 Planned
  - Deploy to staging environment before production

- [ ] **Add performance benchmarks**
  - Status: 📋 Planned
  - Metrics needed:
    - Time to reconcile 100 realms
    - Memory usage under load
    - API call volume to Keycloak

- [ ] **Set up branch protection rules**
  - Status: 📋 TODO - Requires repository admin access
  - Requirements:
    - Require PR reviews
    - Require status checks to pass (unit tests, integration tests, security scans)
    - Require branches to be up to date
    - No direct pushes to main

## 🟣 Phase 4: Polish (Low Priority) - TODO

- [ ] **Add Slack/Discord notifications for releases**
  - Status: 📋 Planned
  - Notify on successful releases

- [ ] **Create workflow for manual operations**
  - Status: 📋 Planned
  - Manual triggers for:
    - Running specific test subsets
    - Deploying to specific environments
    - Emergency rollback

- [ ] **Add flaky test detection**
  - Status: 📋 Planned
  - Track test failures over time
  - Identify intermittently failing tests

- [ ] **Document all workflows in README**
  - Status: 📋 Planned
  - Add comprehensive CI/CD documentation section

- [ ] **Add CI/CD metrics and observability**
  - Status: 📋 Planned
  - Track:
    - Build times
    - Test duration trends
    - GitHub Actions minutes usage
    - Flakiness metrics

## Additional Improvements Identified

- [ ] **Multi-Python version testing**
  - Status: 📋 Planned
  - Test against Python 3.11, 3.12, 3.13
  - Currently only testing 3.13

- [ ] **Multi-Keycloak version testing**
  - Status: 📋 Planned
  - Test against Keycloak 25.x, 26.x, 27.x
  - Currently only testing 26.0.0

- [ ] **Document arm64 testing status**
  - Status: 📋 Planned
  - Either test arm64 builds or document as untested
  - Currently building for arm64 but not explicitly testing

- [ ] **Canary/staged rollout strategy**
  - Status: 📋 Planned
  - Implement: latest → stable → lts tagging
  - Add canary/rc channels for early adopters

- [ ] **Remove or enhance test-summary job**
  - Status: 📋 Planned
  - Either add useful functionality (Slack notifications, issue creation) or remove

## Notes

### Security Scanning Details

The new `security-scan.yml` workflow includes:
- **CodeQL**: SAST for Python code
- **Trivy**: Container image and filesystem scanning
- **pip-audit & safety**: Python dependency vulnerability scanning
- **Syft + Grype**: SBOM generation and validation
- **TruffleHog**: Secret scanning in git history

All results are uploaded to GitHub Security tab for centralized tracking.

### Test Isolation Improvements

- Unique cluster name per run prevents state leakage
- Comprehensive log collection aids debugging
- Multiple K8s versions catch compatibility issues early

### Dependency Management

Dependabot will now automatically:
- Update Python dependencies weekly
- Update GitHub Actions weekly
- Update Docker base images weekly
- Group patch updates to reduce PR noise
- Separate dev dependencies from production deps

### Known Limitations

1. **arm64 builds**: Built but not explicitly tested
2. **workflow_run trigger**: Still has potential race conditions, but mitigated by requiring multiple workflows
3. **Manual rollback**: Currently requires manual intervention
4. **Performance testing**: No automated performance regression detection

## Timeline Estimate

- Phase 1 (Security): ✅ COMPLETED
- Phase 2 (Reliability): ⚠️ 90% complete - ~1 day remaining
- Phase 3 (Operability): 📋 ~1-2 weeks
- Phase 4 (Polish): 📋 ~1-2 weeks

**Total time to full implementation**: ~4-6 weeks of focused work

## Review Grade Progression

- Initial: **B+ (70%)**
- After Phase 1: **A- (85%)** ← Current state
- After Phase 2: **A (90%)**
- After Phase 3+4: **A+ (95%)**
