title: Versioned documentation with mike
category: development
decision: Maintain multiple documentation versions using mike. Previous versions remain
  available on GitHub Pages for users running older operator versions.
agent_instructions: Use mike to manage documentation versions. Deploy new versions
  with 'mike deploy <version>'. Set default version with 'mike set-default <version>'.
  Never delete old documentation versions - users need docs for the version they're
  running. Version selector in docs allows users to switch between versions.
rationale: Users running older operator versions need documentation matching their
  version. Breaking changes in CRDs or APIs require version-specific documentation.
  Mike integrates with MkDocs to provide version switcher in UI. All versions remain
  accessible at predictable URLs. Supports gradual rollouts where different teams
  run different versions. Historical documentation valuable for troubleshooting and
  migrations.
provenance: human
rejected_alternatives:
- alternative: Only publish latest documentation
  reason: Users on older versions have no documentation. Breaking changes leave them
    without guidance.
- alternative: Separate git branches for each version
  reason: Harder to maintain, no version switcher UI, inconsistent navigation between
    versions.
