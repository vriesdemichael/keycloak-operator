title: Everything must be GitOpsable
category: development
decision: All operator functionality must be fully declarative and compatible with
  GitOps workflows (ArgoCD, Flux). No imperative operations or manual interventions
  required.
agent_instructions: When implementing features, ensure they work purely through CRD
  spec declarations. All state must be reconcilable from CRD spec alone. No hidden
  state or manual steps. Test all features with GitOps tools in integration tests.
rationale: 'GitOps is a core requirement, not optional. This enables: - Version control
  for all infrastructure changes - Automated deployments and rollbacks - Disaster
  recovery through declarative state - Compliance and audit requirements Trade-off:
  Some operations may require more complex CRD specs instead of simple CLI commands.'
