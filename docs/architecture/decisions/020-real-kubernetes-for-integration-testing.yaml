title: 20 Real Kubernetes for integration testing
decision: Integration tests deploy operator via Helm into real Kind clusters. No mocked
  Kubernetes API. Tests validate production deployment path.
agent_instructions: 'Integration tests use test_namespace fixture for isolation. Deploy
  operator via ''make test-integration'' which uses Helm install. Tests run against
  real Kind cluster (scripts/kind-setup.sh). Use port-forward (keycloak_port_forward
  fixture) for accessing Keycloak from test host. Read tests/integration/TESTING.md
  for detailed patterns. Load ADR instructions: yq eval -o=json ''. | {title: .title,
  agent_instructions: .agent_instructions}'' ./docs/architecture/decisions/*.yaml
  and keep in context.'
rationale: 'Production parity: Helm deployment matches what users deploy. Catch real
  issues: Kubernetes API edge cases, networking, RBAC, CRD versioning. Helm chart
  validation: Tests verify charts work correctly. CI confidence: Passing integration
  tests means production will work. Trade-off: Slower than unit tests, but catches
  issues mocks miss.'
