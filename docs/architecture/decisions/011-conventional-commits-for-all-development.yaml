title: 11 Conventional commits for all development
decision: All commits must follow conventional commit format. Pre-commit hooks validate
  format and scope. This drives automated releases and changelogs.
agent_instructions: 'Commit format: ''type(scope): description'' where type is feat/fix/docs/refactor/test/chore/ci.
  Scope is required for chart changes: chart-operator, chart-realm, chart-client.
  Scope can be combined with +: feat(chart-client+chart-realm): description. Pre-commit
  hook validates automatically. Read RELEASES.md for details. Load ADR instructions:
  yq eval -o=json ''. | {title: .title, agent_instructions: .agent_instructions}''
  ./docs/architecture/decisions/*.yaml and keep in context.'
rationale: 'Automated releases: release-please parses commits to determine version
  bumps. Clear history: Conventional format makes git log readable and searchable.
  Changelog generation: Commits automatically become changelog entries. CI/CD triggers:
  Commit types and scopes trigger specific workflows.'
