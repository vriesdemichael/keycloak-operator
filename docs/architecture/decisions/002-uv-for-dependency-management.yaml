title: 2 uv for dependency management
decision: Use uv instead of pip, poetry, or pipenv for Python dependency management
  and environment handling.
agent_instructions: 'Always use ''uv run'' for running Python commands. Never use
  ''python'' or ''pip'' directly. Use ''uv sync'' for installing dependencies. Update
  pyproject.toml for dependency changes. Load ADR instructions: yq eval -o=json ''.
  | {title: .title, agent_instructions: .agent_instructions}'' ./docs/architecture/decisions/*.yaml
  and keep in context.'
rationale: 'Lockfiles ensure reproducible builds across environments (uv.lock). Minimal
  image footprint: uv produces smaller, faster Docker images. Speed: uv is significantly
  faster than pip for dependency resolution and installation. Modern standard: uv
  is becoming the Python packaging standard with PEP 723 inline script support.'
