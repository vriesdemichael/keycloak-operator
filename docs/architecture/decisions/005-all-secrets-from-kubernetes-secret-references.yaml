title: 5 All secrets from Kubernetes secret references
decision: All sensitive configuration (passwords, API keys, certificates) must be
  provided via Kubernetes Secret references in CRD specs, never as plaintext in CRDs.
agent_instructions: 'When adding fields for credentials, always use SecretKeySelector
  type (secretName + key). Never accept plaintext secrets in CRD specs. Validate that
  secret references exist during reconciliation. Load ADR instructions: yq eval -o=json
  ''. | {title: .title, agent_instructions: .agent_instructions}'' ./docs/architecture/decisions/*.yaml
  and keep in context.'
rationale: 'Security: Secrets never appear in Git or CRD manifests. GitOps compatible:
  Secret management tools (Sealed Secrets, External Secrets) work seamlessly. Kubernetes
  native: Follows standard K8s patterns for secret handling. RBAC integration: Secret
  access controlled by K8s RBAC, not CRD-level permissions.'
