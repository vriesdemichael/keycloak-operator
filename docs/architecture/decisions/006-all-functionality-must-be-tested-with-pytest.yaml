title: 6 All functionality must be tested with pytest
decision: Every feature, handler, and reconciliation logic must have pytest test coverage.
  No untested code in production.
agent_instructions: 'When implementing features, write tests first or alongside implementation.
  Unit tests required for all reconcilers and utility functions. Integration tests
  required for all CRD operations. Refuse to merge code without tests. Run ''make
  test-pre-commit'' before committing. Load ADR instructions: yq eval -o=json ''.
  | {title: .title, agent_instructions: .agent_instructions}'' ./docs/architecture/decisions/*.yaml
  and keep in context.'
rationale: 'Quality assurance: Tests catch regressions and validate behavior. pytest
  ecosystem: Rich plugin ecosystem (pytest-asyncio, pytest-kubernetes, coverage).
  AI-friendly: Test-driven development works well with LLM assistance. Refactoring
  confidence: Comprehensive tests enable safe code changes.'
