title: 17 Kubernetes RBAC over Keycloak security
decision: Use Kubernetes RBAC to control who can create/modify Keycloak resources.
  Bypass Keycloak's admin UI and built-in security entirely.
agent_instructions: 'Never implement Keycloak user/role authentication in the operator.
  Authorization happens at K8s API level via RBAC on CRDs. Operator uses admin credentials
  (from Secret) only for API calls to Keycloak. Users interact only with CRDs, never
  with Keycloak admin UI. Load ADR instructions: yq eval -o=json ''. | {title: .title,
  agent_instructions: .agent_instructions}'' ./docs/architecture/decisions/*.yaml
  and keep in context.'
rationale: 'Single source of truth: K8s RBAC is the only authorization layer. No dual
  authentication: Eliminates complexity of syncing K8s and Keycloak permissions. GitOps
  compatible: RBAC policies in Git, applied declaratively. Least privilege: Operator
  has admin access, users only have CRD access. Audit trail: K8s audit logs capture
  all authorization decisions.'
