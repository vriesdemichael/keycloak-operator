title: 19 Drift detection and continuous reconciliation
decision: Operator continuously reconciles CRD specs with actual Keycloak state. Detect
  and fix manual changes made outside the operator (drift detection).
agent_instructions: 'Reconcilers compare CRD spec with Keycloak state on every reconciliation.
  Fix drift by updating Keycloak to match CRD spec (CRD is source of truth). Status.phase
  should reflect reconciliation state: Unknown, Pending, Provisioning, Ready, Degraded,
  Failed. Timer handlers re-reconcile periodically to catch drift. Load ADR instructions:
  yq eval -o=json ''. | {title: .title, agent_instructions: .agent_instructions}''
  ./docs/architecture/decisions/*.yaml and keep in context.'
rationale: 'GitOps enforcement: CRD is always the source of truth, manual changes
  are reverted. Self-healing: Detects configuration drift and automatically corrects
  it. Reliability: System converges to desired state even after manual interventions.
  Observability: Status.phase shows current reconciliation state.'
