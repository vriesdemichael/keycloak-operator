title: 9 AI agents as first-class developers
decision: All documentation, code patterns, and development workflows must be accessible
  and optimized for LLM agents. AI assistants should be able to contribute effectively.
agent_instructions: 'This is a meta-ADR. All documentation targets both humans and
  AI agents. CLAUDE.md contains AI-specific guidance. Keep it updated with development
  patterns. ADRs use yq-extractable instructions specifically for agents. Code comments
  explain ''why'', not ''what'' (LLMs understand code structure). Load ADR instructions:
  yq eval -o=json ''. | {title: .title, agent_instructions: .agent_instructions}''
  ./docs/architecture/decisions/*.yaml and keep in context.'
rationale: 'Productivity: LLMs accelerate development when documentation is structured
  for them. Consistency: AI agents follow documented patterns more reliably than humans.
  Onboarding: New AI assistants can start contributing immediately by reading ADRs
  and CLAUDE.md. Future-proof: As AI capabilities improve, this project will benefit
  automatically.'
