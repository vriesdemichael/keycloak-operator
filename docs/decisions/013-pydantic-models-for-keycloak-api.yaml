title: Pydantic models for Keycloak API
category: architecture
decision: Use auto-generated Pydantic models from Keycloak OpenAPI spec for all Keycloak
  Admin API interactions. All requests and responses are validated against these models.
agent_instructions: Always use Pydantic models when interacting with Keycloak Admin
  API. Import models from keycloak_operator.models.keycloak_api (e.g., RealmRepresentation,
  ClientRepresentation). Never construct request data manually with dicts - use the
  Pydantic models. Use _make_validated_request() in KeycloakAdminClient for automatic
  request/response validation. Never manually update keycloak_api.py - regenerate
  from OpenAPI spec using the generation script. Models use snake_case in Python,
  camelCase in API (automatic conversion).
rationale: 'Data validation: Pydantic validates all request/response data against Keycloak
  API schema, catching errors before sending invalid data. This prevents runtime failures
  from schema mismatches, missing required fields, or incorrect data types. Automatic
  schema updates: Regenerate models when Keycloak API changes to stay in sync. IDE
  support: Auto-complete and type hints for all Keycloak API fields improve developer
  productivity. Self-documenting: Models document the exact structure expected by
  Keycloak Admin API.'
rejected_alternatives:
- alternative: Manually construct request dictionaries
  reason: Error-prone, no validation, easy to miss required fields or use wrong types.
    Changes in Keycloak API would silently break requests.
- alternative: Use generic API client without validation
  reason: Would catch errors only at runtime when Keycloak rejects invalid requests,
    making debugging harder and potentially causing reconciliation failures.
