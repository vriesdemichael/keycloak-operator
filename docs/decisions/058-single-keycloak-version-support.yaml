title: Single Keycloak version support (26.x)
category: architecture
decision: Operator supports only Keycloak 26.x (currently 26.4.1). Multiple version
  support is planned but not implemented. Users must use the same Keycloak version
  as defined in DEFAULT_KEYCLOAK_IMAGE constant.
agent_instructions: >
  SUPERSEDED - See ADR-059 for current multi-version support (24.x, 25.x, 26.x).
  This ADR is kept for historical context only.
rationale: 'Single version support simplifies development - no API compatibility matrix,
  no feature detection, no version-specific code paths. Keycloak API relatively stable
  within major versions but changes between majors. Supporting multiple versions requires
  testing each Keycloak version, maintaining compatibility shims, detecting feature
  availability. Resources better spent on core features now. Users can pin operator
  version matching their Keycloak version. When multi-version support added, it will
  be a planned feature (decision 008 feature parity). Current approach: stay on latest
  Keycloak version, update operator when Keycloak updates.'

superseded_by: 59
rejected_alternatives:
- alternative: Support all Keycloak versions 25.0+
  reason: Requires extensive compatibility testing. API differences between versions
    need conditional code. Feature detection complexity.
- alternative: No version enforcement
  reason: Silent failures when API changes. Confusing error messages. Operator assumes
    features present.
- alternative: Support only latest major (27.x when it releases)
  reason: Forces users to upgrade Keycloak before operator. Breaking for existing
    deployments.
