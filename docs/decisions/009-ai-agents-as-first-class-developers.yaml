title: AI agents as first-class developers
category: development
decision: All documentation, code patterns, and development workflows must be accessible
  and optimized for LLM agents. AI assistants should be able to contribute effectively.
agent_instructions: This is a meta-decision record. All documentation targets both
  humans and AI agents. CLAUDE.md contains AI-specific guidance. Keep it updated with
  development patterns. Decision records use yq-extractable instructions specifically
  for agents. Code comments explain 'why', not 'what' (LLMs understand code structure).
rationale: 'Productivity: LLMs accelerate development when documentation is structured
  for them. Consistency: AI agents follow documented patterns more reliably than humans.
  Onboarding: New AI assistants can start contributing immediately by reading ADRs
  and CLAUDE.md. Future-proof: As AI capabilities improve, this project will benefit
  automatically.'
