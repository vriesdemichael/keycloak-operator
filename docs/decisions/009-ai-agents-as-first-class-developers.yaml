title: AI agents as first-class developers
category: development
decision: All development-critical information must be documented in locations where
  AI agents can discover and consume it. This includes AGENTS.md, decision records,
  inline documentation, and architectural docs. LLM agents should have equal access
  to context as human developers.
agent_instructions: |
  Always document information crucial for development in discoverable
  locations. Assumptions about standards, utility functions, architecture, security,
  testing patterns, and workflows belong in AGENTS.md, decision records, or inline
  docs. Never rely on tribal knowledge or undocumented conventions. When you encounter
  undocumented patterns or assumptions, propose adding them to the appropriate documentation.
  Code comments explain 'why' and context, not 'what' (LLMs read code structure directly).

  ADR Documentation Standards:
  - ADRs must follow the strict schema (no extra fields allowed).
  - Use 'agent_instructions' for information that is crucial to know BEFORE working on a specific region (injected into agent context).
  - Use 'decision' or 'rationale' for details that are only relevant when focused on that specific architectural area.
  - This separation ensures agents are not overwhelmed with irrelevant details while maintaining all technical context.
rationale: 'Knowledge accessibility: AI agents need the same context as humans to
  contribute effectively. Standards assumptions (e.g., "always use uv", "prefer CNPG")
  must be explicitly documented, not implicit. Utility functions and architectural
  patterns should be discoverable through AGENTS.md or decision records. Security
  assumptions (e.g., least privilege, no plaintext secrets) codified in decisions.
  This creates a self-documenting codebase where agents can onboard instantly by reading
  structured documentation. Future-proof: As AI capabilities improve, well-documented
  projects benefit automatically.'
rejected_alternatives:
- alternative: Rely on code comments alone for context
  reason: Comments are scattered and don't provide high-level architectural context
    or cross-cutting concerns that decision records capture
- alternative: Only document for humans, let AI learn from code
  reason: Inefficient - agents waste time inferring patterns that could be explicitly
    stated. Leads to inconsistent approaches across different AI sessions.
