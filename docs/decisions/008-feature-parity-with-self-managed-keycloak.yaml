title: Feature parity with self-managed Keycloak
category: architecture
decision: The operator must support all Keycloak configuration options available in
  self-managed instances. CRDs should map 1:1 to Keycloak Admin API capabilities.
agent_instructions: Map CRD fields directly to Keycloak API representations. Use
  Pydantic models from src/keycloak_operator/models/keycloak_api.py (generated from
  OpenAPI spec keycloak-api-spec.yaml). Support all Keycloak features. Document any
  intentional feature exclusions with rationale.
rationale: 'No lock-in: Users can migrate from self-managed to operator-managed without
  losing functionality. Complete solution: Operator should handle all Keycloak use
  cases, not just basic ones. API alignment: Following Keycloak''s data models ensures
  correctness and updates. Trade-off: Larger CRD specs, but complete feature coverage.'
