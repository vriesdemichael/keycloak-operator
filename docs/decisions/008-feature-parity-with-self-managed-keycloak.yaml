title: Feature parity with self-managed Keycloak
category: architecture
decision: The operator must support all Keycloak configuration options available in
  self-managed instances. CRDs should map 1:1 to Keycloak Admin API capabilities.
agent_instructions: 'When adding CRD fields, map them directly to Keycloak API representations.
  Use Pydantic models from keycloak_api.py generated from OpenAPI spec. Support all
  Keycloak features: realms, clients, identity providers, users, roles, themes, etc.
  Document any intentional feature exclusions with rationale.'
rationale: 'No lock-in: Users can migrate from self-managed to operator-managed without
  losing functionality. Complete solution: Operator should handle all Keycloak use
  cases, not just basic ones. API alignment: Following Keycloak''s data models ensures
  correctness and updates. Trade-off: Larger CRD specs, but complete feature coverage.'
