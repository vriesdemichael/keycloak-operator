title: No Network Policies in Helm Chart
category: architecture
decision: We will not include Kubernetes NetworkPolicy resources in the Keycloak Operator
  Helm chart.
agent_instructions: Do not accept requests to add NetworkPolicy templates to the Helm
  chart. Direct users to manage network security at the platform level.
rationale: 'Network Policies are highly specific to the underlying CNI (Calico, Cilium,
  Flannel, etc.) and cluster network architecture. Including them creates a "lowest
  common denominator" policy that is rarely sufficient for production while adding
  maintenance burden. We follow the principle of "separation of concerns": the operator
  chart manages the application, while network security should be managed by the platform
  team/infrastructure-as-code. Users can easily add NetworkPolicies alongside the
  release using GitOps.'
provenance: human
rejected_alternatives:
- alternative: Optional NetworkPolicies
  reason: Adds template complexity and testing burden for features that are often
    replaced by Service Mesh or CNI-specific CRDs.
