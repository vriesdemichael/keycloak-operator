title: Helm charts published to GitHub Pages OCI registry
category: development
decision: Publish all three Helm charts (operator, realm, client) to GitHub Pages
  which serves as an OCI registry. Charts are available at https://vriesdemichael.github.io/keycloak-operator/charts/
agent_instructions: Package Helm charts and publish to GitHub Pages charts directory.
  Maintain index.yaml with all chart versions. Charts are served via GitHub Pages
  and can be added to Helm with 'helm repo add'. Keep charts directory in gh-pages
  branch synchronized with releases. Never delete old chart versions - users may be
  pinned to specific versions.
rationale: GitHub Pages provides free, reliable hosting for Helm charts. OCI registry
  format allows versioned chart distribution. Users can pin to specific chart versions
  for stability. Helm repo index allows 'helm search repo' to discover versions. Integrated
  with release process - charts published automatically on release. No external registry
  costs or management. Charts accessible globally via CDN with SSL.
provenance: human
rejected_alternatives:
- alternative: Use external chart registry (ChartMuseum, Harbor)
  reason: Additional infrastructure to maintain. Costs money. GitHub Pages is free
    and reliable.
- alternative: Bundle charts in git repository only
  reason: Users would need to clone repo to get charts. No version discovery. Not
    standard Helm workflow.
