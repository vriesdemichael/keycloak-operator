title: Kopf as operator framework
category: architecture
decision: Use Kopf (Python) instead of Go-based frameworks (controller-runtime, operator-sdk)
  for implementing the Keycloak operator.
agent_instructions: When implementing operator logic or handlers, always use Kopf
  decorators and patterns.
rationale: 'Better LLM support: Python is better understood by language models, enabling
  more effective AI-assisted development. Better testing: pytest ecosystem is more
  mature and flexible than Go testing frameworks. SRE-friendly: Python aligns better
  with SRE backgrounds and existing automation tooling. Trade-off: Slightly higher
  resource usage acceptable for operators managing relatively few resources.'
