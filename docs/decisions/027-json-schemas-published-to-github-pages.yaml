title: JSON schemas published to GitHub Pages
category: development
decision: Publish CRD JSON schemas to GitHub Pages for IDE validation and auto-completion.
  Schemas are available at https://vriesdemichael.github.io/keycloak-operator/schemas/
agent_instructions: Generate JSON schemas from CRDs using scripts/generate-crd-schemas.py.
  Publish schemas to GitHub Pages alongside documentation and Helm charts. Users reference
  schemas in their IDE or CI for validation. Keep schemas in sync with CRD changes
  - regenerate when CRDs are updated.
rationale: JSON schemas enable IDE validation and auto-completion for CRD YAML files.
  Developers get immediate feedback on invalid configurations before applying to cluster.
  Schemas are versioned alongside releases, allowing users to validate against specific
  operator versions. Publishing to GitHub Pages makes schemas publicly accessible
  without authentication. Integration with IDEs (VSCode, IntelliJ) improves developer
  experience.
provenance: human
rejected_alternatives:
- alternative: Don't publish schemas - rely on kubectl validation only
  reason: kubectl validation happens too late (at apply time). IDE validation catches
    errors during editing.
- alternative: Bundle schemas in operator image
  reason: Not accessible to users writing CRDs. Can't use for IDE validation.
