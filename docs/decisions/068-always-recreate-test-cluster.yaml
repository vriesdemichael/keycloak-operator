title: Always recreate test cluster
category: development
decision: >
  Integration tests must always run on a freshly created Kind cluster.
  The "cluster reuse" workflow is abandoned in favor of reproducibility and reliability.
  The `task test:all` command will alias `task test:all` which performs a full teardown and setup.
agent_instructions: >
  Do not attempt to optimize testing by reusing existing clusters.
  Always expect and use the full teardown/setup cycle.
  The `task test:all` command is the single source of truth for running the full test suite.
rationale: >
  Cluster reuse and cleanup logic proved to be flaky and complex ("messy cleanup").
  Recreating the cluster ensures a pristine environment for every test run, eliminating state leakage and "works on my machine" issues.
  While slower, it guarantees that test results are valid and reproducible.
  The build cache is enabled to mitigate some of the speed loss.
