title: uv for dependency management
category: development
decision: Use uv instead of pip, poetry, or pipenv for Python dependency management
  and environment handling.
agent_instructions: Always use 'uv run' for running Python commands. Never use 'python'
  or 'pip' directly. Use 'uv sync' for installing dependencies. Update pyproject.toml
  for dependency changes.
rationale: 'Lockfiles ensure reproducible builds across environments (uv.lock). Minimal
  image footprint: uv produces smaller, faster Docker images. Speed: uv is significantly
  faster than pip for dependency resolution and installation. Modern standard: uv
  is becoming the Python packaging standard with PEP 723 inline script support.'
