title: Prometheus metrics exposure
category: architecture
decision: Expose Prometheus metrics from operator for monitoring reconciliation performance,
  API calls, rate limiting, and errors.
agent_instructions: 'Instrument operator code with Prometheus metrics. Expose metrics
  endpoint on management port. Track: reconciliation duration, API call counts, rate
  limit waits, error rates, resource counts. Include labels for resource type, namespace,
  operation. Document available metrics.'
rationale: Metrics enable monitoring operator health and performance. Track reconciliation
  lag, API bottlenecks, rate limiting impact. Alert on error rates or reconciliation
  failures. Prometheus is standard for Kubernetes monitoring. Metrics help capacity
  planning and troubleshooting. Essential for production operations.
provenance: human
rejected_alternatives:
- alternative: Logging only, no metrics
  reason: Logs don't aggregate easily. Can't graph trends or set numeric alerts. Poor
    visibility into system health.
- alternative: Custom metrics format
  reason: Prometheus is Kubernetes standard. Custom format requires special tooling,
    reduces interoperability.
