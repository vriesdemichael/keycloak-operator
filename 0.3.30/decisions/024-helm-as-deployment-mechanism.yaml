title: Helm as deployment mechanism
category: development
decision: Use Helm charts as the primary deployment mechanism for the operator and
  CRD resources. Plain manifests and Kustomize are not supported.
agent_instructions: Always provide Helm charts for deployable components. Do not create
  plain Kubernetes manifests or Kustomize overlays as alternatives. When users ask
  for deployment options, direct them to Helm charts. All configuration options must
  be exposed as Helm values with sensible defaults.
rationale: Plain manifests allow no configuration - users get a default operator in
  a default namespace with no flexibility. Kustomize provides some flexibility but
  easily breaks when required parameters are not overridden, leading to invalid deployments.
  Helm provides proper configuration management with values.yaml, type validation,
  and defaults. Helm integrates well with GitOps tools (ArgoCD, Flux) through native
  Helm support. Helm charts can be properly versioned and published to registries,
  enabling version pinning and upgrades. Helm's templating catches configuration errors
  at render time, not deployment time.
provenance: human
rejected_alternatives:
- alternative: Plain Kubernetes manifests
  reason: No configuration options. Users stuck with hardcoded defaults for namespace,
    resources, images, etc.
- alternative: Kustomize
  reason: Easy to miss required parameter overrides, resulting in broken deployments.
    Less GitOps tool support than Helm.
