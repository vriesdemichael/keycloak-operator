title: GitHub Issues for planned work with AI agent instructions
category: development
decision: All planned work tracked in GitHub Issues with dedicated "AI Instructions"
  section. Work done in feature branches linked to issues. AI agents implement issues
  with human guidance, then open PRs with auto-rebase on completion.
agent_instructions: 'GitHub Issues are the single source of truth for planned work.
  Issue template at .github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/issue.yml includes "AI Instructions" field
  for agent-specific guidance (line 43-52). Workflow: 1) Create issue with description
  and AI instructions, 2) Create feature branch linked to issue, 3) AI agent implements
  following instructions, asking user for missing input/decisions, 4) Human verifies
  work, 5) AI opens PR with auto-rebase (gh pr merge --auto --rebase), 6) PR auto-merges
  when checks pass. Branch naming: feature/issue-123-description or fix/issue-123-description.
  PR title references issue: "feat: implement X (#123)".'
rationale: 'GitHub Issues provide structured planning with visibility and tracking.
  AI Instructions field guides agents with context-specific hints (modules to focus
  on, constraints, known issues). Reduces back-and-forth by frontloading guidance.
  Feature branches isolate work-in-progress from main. Auto-rebase keeps history clean
  without manual intervention. Human verification before PR prevents premature merging.
  Auto-merge after checks pass reduces manual overhead while ensuring CI validates
  changes. Issue linking provides traceability from problem to solution. Standardized
  workflow enables consistent collaboration between humans and AI agents.'
provenance: human
rejected_alternatives:
- alternative: Work directly on main branch
  reason: No isolation for WIP. Risky - broken code affects everyone. Can't review
    before merge.
- alternative: Manual PR merging
  reason: Requires human to monitor CI and click merge. Wastes time. Auto-merge with
    checks is safer and faster.
- alternative: No AI Instructions field in issues
  reason: Agents lack context. More questions, slower implementation. AI Instructions
    provide upfront guidance.
- alternative: Linear or Jira for issue tracking
  reason: GitHub Issues integrates with PRs, code, CI. External tools add friction.
    GitHub native is simpler.
