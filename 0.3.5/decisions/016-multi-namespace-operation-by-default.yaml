title: Multi-namespace operation by default
category: architecture
decision: Operator watches and manages resources across all namespaces by default.
  Not namespace-scoped. Team isolation via Kubernetes RBAC, not operator scope.
agent_instructions: Handlers use '@kopf.on' without namespace parameter (watches all
  namespaces). Authorization happens via K8s RBAC on CRD access, not namespace boundaries.
  When checking permissions, verify CRD RBAC, not namespace ownership. Support --namespace
  flag for debugging, but default is cluster-wide.
rationale: 'Dynamic provisioning: Clients in any namespace can reference realms in
  other namespaces (if RBAC allows). Flexibility: Single operator instance serves
  entire cluster. RBAC-based isolation: Teams are isolated via K8s RBAC, more secure
  than namespace scoping. Operational efficiency: One operator deployment instead
  of per-namespace deployments.'
