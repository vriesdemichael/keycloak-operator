title: Semantic versioning for all artifacts
category: development
decision: All artifacts (operator image, Helm charts, documentation) use semantic
  versioning (semver). Releases are automated via release-please with conventional
  commits.
agent_instructions: 'Use conventional commits: feat: (minor), fix: (patch), BREAKING
  CHANGE: (major). Use scopes for chart releases: feat(chart-operator):, feat(chart-realm):,
  feat(chart-client):. Read RELEASES.md for complete versioning rules. Never manually
  update version numbers - release-please handles it.'
rationale: 'Predictability: Users know impact of upgrades from version numbers. Automation:
  release-please automates changelog generation and version bumps. Multi-component:
  Independent versioning for operator and each Helm chart. CI/CD integration: Versions
  trigger specific deployment workflows.'
