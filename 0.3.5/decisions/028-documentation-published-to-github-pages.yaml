title: Documentation published to GitHub Pages
category: development
decision: Publish all project documentation to GitHub Pages at https://vriesdemichael.github.io/keycloak-operator/
  using MkDocs with Material theme.
agent_instructions: Maintain documentation in docs/ directory using Markdown. Build
  documentation with MkDocs. Documentation is automatically published to GitHub Pages
  on pushes to main branch. Keep documentation in sync with code changes - update
  docs when adding features.
rationale: GitHub Pages provides free, reliable hosting for project documentation.
  MkDocs with Material theme provides professional appearance and good UX (search,
  navigation, mobile support). Versioned documentation matches versioned releases.
  Users can access documentation without cloning repository. GitHub Pages SSL and
  CDN provide fast, secure access globally. Integrated with CI/CD for automatic publishing.
provenance: human
rejected_alternatives:
- alternative: Documentation only in README.md
  reason: Single file doesn't scale for complex project. No proper navigation or search.
- alternative: Wiki or separate documentation site
  reason: Harder to keep in sync with code. Wiki doesn't support versioning or CI/CD
    publishing.
