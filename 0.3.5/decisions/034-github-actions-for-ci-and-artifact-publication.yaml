title: GitHub Actions for CI and artifact publication
category: development
decision: 'Use GitHub Actions for all CI/CD pipelines: testing, building, publishing
  container images, Helm charts, documentation, and releases.'
agent_instructions: Define CI/CD workflows in .github/workflows/. Use GitHub Actions
  for all automation - testing, building, publishing. Leverage GitHub's container
  registry (ghcr.io) for images, GitHub Pages for charts/docs. Don't introduce external
  CI systems. Keep workflows modular and reusable.
rationale: GitHub Actions integrates natively with GitHub - no external CI setup needed.
  Free for public repos. Direct access to GitHub APIs for releases, comments, etc.
  GitHub Container Registry (ghcr.io) included. GitHub Pages publishing built-in.
  Secrets management integrated. Good marketplace of reusable actions. Workflows version-controlled
  alongside code. Eliminates external dependencies.

rejected_alternatives:
- alternative: Jenkins, CircleCI, or other external CI
  reason: Additional infrastructure to maintain. Costs money. Extra authentication/secrets
    management.
- alternative: GitLab CI
  reason: Would require moving repository. GitHub Actions already available and sufficient.
