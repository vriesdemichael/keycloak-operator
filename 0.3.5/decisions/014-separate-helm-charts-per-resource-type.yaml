title: Separate Helm charts per resource type
category: architecture
decision: 'Maintain independent Helm charts: keycloak-operator, keycloak-realm, keycloak-client.
  Each chart has independent versioning and release cycles.'
agent_instructions: 'Chart-specific changes require scoped commits: feat(chart-operator):,
  feat(chart-realm):, feat(chart-client):. Each chart in charts/ directory has its
  own Chart.yaml version. Chart releases are independent of operator image releases.
  Helm repository contains all chart versions at https://vriesdemichael.github.io/keycloak-operator/charts.'
rationale: 'Flexibility: Users can update charts independently of operator. Separation
  of concerns: Operator chart vs resource CRD charts have different lifecycles. GitOps
  friendly: Teams can pin different chart versions per environment. Helm best practices:
  One chart per deployable unit.'
