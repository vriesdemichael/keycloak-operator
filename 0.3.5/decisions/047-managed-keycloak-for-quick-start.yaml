title: Managed Keycloak for quick start
category: architecture
decision: Provide managed Keycloak option (operator deploys Keycloak) for quick start
  experience. No separate Keycloak installation required to begin using operator.
agent_instructions: 'Implement Keycloak CRD deployment mode where operator manages
  full Keycloak lifecycle: deployment, configuration, upgrades. Provide sensible defaults
  for getting started. Include quickstart examples with managed Keycloak. Document
  both managed and external modes clearly.'
rationale: Managed Keycloak reduces time-to-first-value. Users can deploy operator
  and start creating realms/clients immediately without separate Keycloak setup. Lowers
  adoption barrier for evaluation and development. Operator can optimize Keycloak
  configuration for its use cases. Still support external Keycloak for production
  where Keycloak is managed separately. Best of both worlds.
provenance: human
rejected_alternatives:
- alternative: External Keycloak only
  reason: High barrier to entry. Users must deploy Keycloak manually before using
    operator. Complicates getting started.
- alternative: Managed Keycloak only
  reason: Doesn't support existing Keycloak deployments. Forces users to migrate.
