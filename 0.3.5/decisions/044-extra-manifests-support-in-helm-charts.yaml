title: Extra manifests support in Helm charts
category: development
decision: All three Helm charts support extraManifests value to inject additional
  Kubernetes resources. Enables users to add custom resources without forking charts.
agent_instructions: Add extraManifests value to all charts (operator, realm, client).
  Template renders them via 'tpl' function to allow value interpolation. Document
  in values.yaml with examples. Users can inject ServiceMonitors, NetworkPolicies,
  PodDisruptionBudgets, etc. without chart modifications.
rationale: Users often need to add supporting resources (monitoring, network policies,
  etc.) specific to their environment. Forking charts to add these creates maintenance
  burden. extraManifests provides escape hatch for custom resources. Common pattern
  in Helm ecosystem. Keeps charts flexible without bloating default manifests. Users
  maintain full control over additional resources through values.yaml.
provenance: human
rejected_alternatives:
- alternative: Force users to fork charts
  reason: Creates maintenance burden. Users must rebase forks on chart updates. Discourages
    chart usage.
- alternative: Add every possible resource type to chart
  reason: Charts become bloated. Can't anticipate all use cases. Increases complexity.
