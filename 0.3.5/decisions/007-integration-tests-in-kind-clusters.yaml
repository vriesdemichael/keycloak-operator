title: Integration tests in Kind clusters
category: development
decision: Integration tests must run in real Kind (Kubernetes in Docker) clusters
  with real Keycloak instances. No mocked operators, no mocked Keycloak.
agent_instructions: Integration tests use 'make test-integration' which creates Kind
  clusters. Never mock the operator or Keycloak in integration tests - use real deployments.
  Tests must deploy via Helm charts to validate production-like scenarios. Read tests/integration/TESTING.md
  for patterns and requirements.
rationale: 'Production parity: Tests run against the same environment as production
  (real K8s, real Keycloak). Catch integration issues: Mocks hide networking, timing,
  and state issues that only appear in real clusters. Helm chart validation: Tests
  verify the actual deployment artifacts users will use. CI/CD confidence: If it passes
  integration tests, it works in production. Trade-off: Slower test execution, but
  higher confidence in results.'
