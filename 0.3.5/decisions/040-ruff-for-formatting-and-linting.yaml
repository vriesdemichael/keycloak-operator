title: Ruff for formatting and linting
category: development
decision: Use Ruff for both code formatting and linting. Ruff replaces multiple tools
  (Black, isort, Flake8, etc.) with a single fast tool.
agent_instructions: Run 'ruff format' for code formatting. Run 'ruff check --fix'
  for linting. Configure Ruff in pyproject.toml. Use 'make format' and 'make lint'
  targets. Never introduce Black, isort, Flake8, or other legacy linters. Ruff handles
  all Python code quality checks.
rationale: Ruff is 10-100x faster than legacy Python linters. Single tool replaces
  Black (formatting), isort (imports), Flake8 (linting), pyupgrade, etc. Reduces dependencies
  and configuration complexity. Written in Rust for speed. Same team makes ty type
  checker - good ecosystem integration. Pre-commit hooks run faster with Ruff.
provenance: human
rejected_alternatives:
- alternative: Black + isort + Flake8
  reason: Slow, multiple tools to configure and maintain. Ruff is drop-in replacement
    that's much faster.
- alternative: Pylint
  reason: Very slow, overly verbose. Ruff covers same checks with better performance.
