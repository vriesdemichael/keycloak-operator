title: Automated releases with release-please
category: development
decision: Automate release process using release-please. Releases are triggered by
  conventional commits and create GitHub releases, changelogs, and version bumps automatically.
agent_instructions: Follow conventional commit format (covered in decision 011). release-please
  analyzes commits to determine version bumps (major/minor/patch). Never manually
  create releases or update version numbers. Let release-please handle changelog generation
  from commit messages. Review and merge release PRs created by release-please to
  trigger releases.
rationale: release-please eliminates manual release toil (changelog writing, version
  bumping, tag creation). Conventional commits provide machine-readable history for
  automatic version determination. Changelogs generated from commits stay accurate
  and complete. Separate versioning for operator and each Helm chart (via commit scopes).
  Release PRs provide review opportunity before publishing. Consistent release process
  reduces errors.
provenance: human
rejected_alternatives:
- alternative: Manual releases with hand-written changelogs
  reason: Error-prone, time-consuming, changelogs drift from actual changes. Inconsistent
    versioning.
- alternative: Semantic-release or other tools
  reason: release-please better supports monorepo with multiple versioned components
    (operator + 3 charts).
