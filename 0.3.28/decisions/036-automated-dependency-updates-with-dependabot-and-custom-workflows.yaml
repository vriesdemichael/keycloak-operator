title: Automated dependency updates with Dependabot and custom workflows
category: development
decision: Use Dependabot for Python and GitHub Actions dependencies. Use custom GitHub
  Action workflow to bump operator image tag in Helm chart values.yaml when new operator
  versions are released.
agent_instructions: Configure Dependabot for Python dependencies (pyproject.toml)
  and GitHub Actions workflows. Maintain separate workflow that updates charts/keycloak-*/values.yaml
  with new operator image tags when operator releases are created. Review and merge
  Dependabot PRs regularly.
rationale: 'Dependabot automates dependency updates for Python packages and GitHub
  Actions, reducing security vulnerabilities and keeping dependencies current. Automatic
  PRs make updates visible and reviewable. Custom workflow for Helm values ensures
  charts reference correct operator versions without manual updates. Separate concerns:
  Dependabot for general deps, custom workflow for operator-chart coupling.'
provenance: human
rejected_alternatives:
- alternative: Manual dependency updates
  reason: Error-prone, easy to miss security updates, consumes developer time.
- alternative: Renovate or other dependency bots
  reason: Dependabot is GitHub-native, no additional setup needed. Sufficient for
    project needs.
