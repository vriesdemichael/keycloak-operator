title: No Network Policies in Helm Chart
category: architecture
decision: We will not include Kubernetes NetworkPolicy resources in the Keycloak Operator
  Helm chart.
agent_instructions: Do not accept requests to add NetworkPolicy templates to the Helm
  chart. Direct users to manage network security at the platform level.
rationale: 'Keycloak''s primary function relies on external user interaction (login prompts,
  redirects) which requires secure external TLS access. Internal service-to-service
  communication (e.g. for token exchange) creates potential configuration issues
  ("config hell") due to mismatches between external issuer URLs and internal service
  URLs. The complexity of managing these network restrictions outweighs the minimal
  security gain, as the application is designed to be public-facing.'
provenance: human
rejected_alternatives:
- alternative: Optional NetworkPolicies
  reason: Adds template complexity and testing burden for features that are often
    replaced by Service Mesh or CNI-specific CRDs.
