title: Taskfile for development automation
category: development
decision: Use Taskfile as the primary interface for all development tasks, replacing
  Makefile. All common workflows (testing, quality checks, deployment, cluster management)
  must have corresponding Taskfile tasks.
agent_instructions: Always check the Taskfile.yml for existing tasks before running
  commands directly. Use 'task --list' to see available tasks. When adding new development
  workflows, create corresponding tasks with descriptive help text. Use namespaced
  tasks (e.g., 'test:unit', 'cluster:create') for better organization. Ensure tasks
  are idempotent where possible using 'status' checks or 'sources/generates'. Do not
  use 'make' commands anymore.
rationale: Taskfile provides a modern, robust alternative to Make with better cross-platform
  support, built-in dependency management (DAG), parallel execution, and declarative
  syntax (YAML). It supports checksum-based caching (sources/generates) and status
  checks natively, enabling true idempotency. This allows us to unify CI/CD and local
  development workflows using the exact same commands.
supersedes: 23
provenance: autonomous-ai
rejected_alternatives:
- alternative: Keep Makefile
  reason: Make syntax is arcane, hard to maintain for complex dependencies, and lacks
    native checksum/status features.
- alternative: Shell scripts only
  reason: Hard to discover, no dependency management, harder to compose.
