title: Make for development automation
category: development
decision: Use Make as the primary interface for all development tasks. All common
  workflows (testing, quality checks, deployment, cluster management) must have corresponding
  Make targets.
agent_instructions: Always check the Makefile for existing targets before running
  commands directly. Use 'make help' to see available targets. When adding new development
  workflows, create corresponding Make targets with descriptive help text. Never document
  raw commands in guides - reference Make targets instead (e.g., 'make test-integration'
  not 'uv run pytest tests/integration'). Make targets provide consistent interface
  across different environments.
rationale: Make provides a standardized, discoverable interface for all development
  tasks. Developers and AI agents can run 'make help' to see all available commands.
  Make targets abstract away complexity (uv, pytest flags, cluster setup) into simple,
  memorable commands. Documentation stays in sync because commands are defined once
  in Makefile. Cross-platform compatibility - Make works on Linux, macOS, Windows
  (WSL). CI/CD uses same Make targets as local development, ensuring consistency.
provenance: human
rejected_alternatives:
- alternative: Use shell scripts in scripts/ directory
  reason: Less discoverable, no built-in help system, harder to compose tasks. Make
    provides dependency management and built-in help.
- alternative: Use task runners like Taskfile or Just
  reason: Make is universally available, well-understood, and doesn't require additional
    tooling. Taskfile/Just add dependencies.
- alternative: Document raw commands
  reason: Commands change (different flags, tools, paths). Make targets provide stable
    interface even as underlying commands evolve.
